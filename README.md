route53_auto-update
===================

Automatically update a route53 entry at init.
--------------

**To make these scripts work for you you need to make a few edits:**
- First, Add your Hosted_Zone ID in dyndns_route53.py
- Then enter the domain name that you want kept up-to-date


**I highly suggest storing dyndns_route53.py in S3 or somewhere where your instance can easily download it.**
- Edit user-data to point at the location of dyndns_route53.py

- The contents of this file go in the user-data field when spinning up an instance or setting up an auto-scaling rule.

**If you are going to be using the IAM role I provided you need to edit it to point at the correct hosted-zone**


*I will likely expand this role in a future update to grant permissions to the python script in S3. Right now I have that 
script set as public.*
